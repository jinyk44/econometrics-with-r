# Probability Theory Review
## Random Variables and Probability Distributions
- Outcomes
> The mutually exclusive results of a random process
- Probability 
> The proportion that the outcome occurs in the long run, that is, if the experiment is repeated many times
- Sample space
> The set of all possible outcomes of a random variable
- Event 
> Subset of the sample space and consists of one or more outcomes
## Probability Distributions of Discrete Random Variables
- PDF(Probability Distribution Function)
> The list of all possible values of the variable and their probabilities which sum to 1
- CDF(Cumulative Probability Distribution Function)
> Gives the probability that the random variable is less than or equal to a particular value
## Probability Distributions of Continuous Random Variables
- PDF(Probability Density Function)
